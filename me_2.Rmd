# The default names for the votes are way too long to use. I am curious about
# patterns across precincts. Which are the most Democratic and Republican? I am
# also curious about ballot_style. Do these effect votes, a la all the crazyness
# is Florida?

# There are 166 ballot sytles and 428 precincts. 

# Does vote, which seems to be an integer but which I currently read in as a
# double, mean something? Note that not every number is used. For example, there
# is no 5 or 7. 

# There is definite structure to vote numbers. For example, every vote wth a
# number before 1346 is in Fayette. But there is also overlap in that many
# precincts have at least some votes (mail-in votes?) with very high numbers.
# Anyway, it is certainly impossible that vote captures the temporal ordering of
# when voting occured, which is the variable I really want.

names(x) <- c("vote", "precinct", "ballot_style", 
              "choice_1", "choice_2", "choice_3", "choice_4", "choice_5")

# But we already know that we are going to want some tidy data. Should we tidy
# it here or later? Let's stick with later.

# vote is not a good variable for organizing things, not least because the
# distribution is not uniform. But we still need a variable that we will use to
# "group" the voting for the animation. In what order should votes "appear" in
# the animation? We will use the `vote_id` variable for this purpose.

# We could go with a random order by assigning vote_id to a random value between
# 1 and nrow(x). But the law of large numbers (?) makes this a poor choice since
# it ensures that everything is "too" smooth. Poliquin leads Golden by about 1%
# all the way through. We want more (fake?) jumpiness.

# The obvious choices are to group votes by either ballot style or precinct. We
# could just use those groupings raw --- meaning all the votes in Abbot appear
# in the graphic at once --- or we could number votes within those categories.

# Maybe give the viewer a choice, which would highlight how the leaderboard can
# change as different areas report, thereby making it hard to forecast the
# winner mid-way through election night?

# For now, vote_id is grouped by precinct but still a unique number.

x <- x %>% 
  sample_n(10000) %>%     # Make things faster
  arrange(precinct) %>% 
  mutate(vote_id = row_number())

# One class project is to create to this tibble, so I need to write it out and
# push it.

```{r cum_votes}
# I want to graph the cumulative votes with gganimate. Easiest (?) way to do
# that is to first create a function which transforms choices into cumulative
# votes. (Note that this could be a one-liner, but I show each step separately
# for clarity.)

choice_to_votes <- function(choice, name){
  votes <- ifelse(str_detect(choice, name), 1, 0)
  votes <- cumsum(votes)
  as.integer(votes)
}

# Note that I am only doing this for choice_1. Could do it for, at least,
# choice_2, if only to be ready to deal with ranked choice voting issues. I also
# think that ballot design might be an interesting thing to look at.

x$Poliquin <- choice_to_votes(x$choice_1, "Poliquin")
# x$Bond <- choice_to_votes(x$choice_1, "Bond")
# x$Hoar <- choice_to_votes(x$choice_1, "Hoar")
# x$undervote <- choice_to_votes(x$choice_1, "undervote")
# x$overvote <- choice_to_votes(x$choice_1, "overvote")
x$Golden <- choice_to_votes(x$choice_1, "Golden")

# We know what the official vote totals are from the first round, so we can
# check our calculations. Unfortunately, they do not match exactly! Poliquin got
# 131,631 and Golden 128,999 in the first round. This is close to what I see,
# but not exactly the same. What is up with that? Maybe a complication
# associated with under/overvotes?

# Make this data tidy and get rid of useless columns.

final <- x %>%
  select(vote_id, precinct, ballot_style, Poliquin:Golden) %>% 
  gather(key = "candidate", value = "cum_votes", Poliquin:Golden)

# This is the second target tibble that students should work towards.


```





```{r animate, cache=TRUE}
# There are at least two animations which might be fun. First, show the
# cumulative votes as a line graph. Doing this by precinct, in alphabetical
# order, shows that there was a period in which Golden was ahead, about 1/3 of
# the way through the voting. Second, a column chart which grows in height for
# each candidate as the votes come in. Or perhaps this should be beeswarm or
# even a column chart with jitter so it looks like an empty bar is being filled.

# I need to be careful, though, because almost 300k rows is breaking gganimate,
# at least with transition_state() and the shadow_mark() option.

  geom_point(size = 0.1) +
  transition_time(vote_id) +
